### Task: 
Analyze and classify the patient’s responses, assess the clarity of the conversation, determine if it concludes with a clear "yes" or "no" answer, and provide guidance based on these evaluations.
{% endif %}


{% if 'INSTRUCTION' in section or 'ALL' in section %}
### Instructions:
1. **Analyze the conversation**: Review the conversation to check if it is on-topic and if the patient’s responses are clear.
2. **Clarity of Response**: Rate the clarity of each response based on its relevance and directness in addressing the original question. If the responses are clear, relevant, and direct, assign a high score (0.8 to 1.0); if they are vague, unclear, or irrelevant, assign a low score (0.0 to 0.2).
3. **Conclusion Evaluation**: Evaluate if the conversation conclusively answers the question with a clear "approval" or "denial." If the conversation is conclusing towards "approval" for the question then give a high score (0.8 to 1.0) and if the conversation is conclusing towards "denial" for the question then give a low score (0.0 to 0.2).
4. **Guidance and Follow-up**: If the responses are off-topic or unclear, provide a prompt guiding the user to stay focused on the topic.
5. **Scoring**:
   - **Clarity Score** (0.0 to 1.0): Measures how clear and relevant the conversation is to the question.
     - High score = Relevant, direct answers.
     - Low score = Vague, irrelevant answers.
   - **Positive Score** (0.0 to 1.0): Measures whether the conversation leads to a definite conclusion ("yes" or "no").
     - High score = Clear conclusion with a assertive answer which says "I am experiencing what is asked in the question.", or conversation is conclusing towards "approval" for the question
     - Low score = Clear conclusion with a assertive answer which says "I am not experiencing what is asked in the question." or conversation is conclusing towards "denial" for the question
    ###NOTE###
    If the conversation is not clear, not referring to the question or user didnt understand the question then positive score should be near 0.5.

6. **Final Conclusion and Guidance**: Provide the final scores and any necessary clarification or follow-up questions.
