### Instructions:
Provide step-by-step reasoning for the clarity and positive scores, referencing the chat summary and the latest conversation.
Step 1. Question Analysis: Analyze the Question and figure out if the question contains multiple parts or if it is a single question.
  - If the question contains multiple parts, then analyze the user's response wheather user is answering all parts of the question.
  - Dont go into the specifics just check if the user is answering the question directly. Major, most, less, insignificant, etc. are the words that can be used to check the frequency or the impact of the symptom.

Step 2. Chat Summary: Generate a concise summary of the conversation, focusing on:
  - Whether the responses provide a clear answer to the specific question.
  - Key points indicating agreement or disagreement.
  - Any ambiguity or need for follow-up.

Step 3. Evaluate Clarity Score:
  - Identify key points from the <Chat Summary> and the latest conversation that relate to the <Question>.
  - Assess the relevance, clarity, and alignment of the conversation with the <Question>.
  - Generate a Clarity Score based on the relevance and clarity of the conversation.
    - Clarity Score (0.0 to 1.0):
      - High score (close to 1.0) = If the response is complete and relevant to the question.
      - Low score (close to 0.0) = If the responses are incomplete means giving only paretial answer for different parts of the question or if the responses are irrelevant to the question. 

Step 4. Evaluate Positive Score:
  - Identify key points from the <Chat Summary> and the latest conversation that relate to the <Question>.
  - Determine whether the user’s responses indicate agreement, disagreement, or uncertainty regarding the symptom.
  - Evaluate the user's responce based on the impact of the symptom.
    - Positive Score (0.0 to 1.0):
      - High score (close to 1.0) = The user clearly agrees with the symptom or if user response is very positive.
      - Moderate score (around 0.5) = The user's response is ambiguous or uncertain.
      - Low score (close to 0.0) = The user clearly disagrees with the symptom or if the symptom is very mild or its normal human behavior.

Step 5. Concluding Prompt and Clarification Guidance:
  - Provide a final conclusion based on the conversation.
  - give Low Clarity Score: If the conversation lacks clarity or incomplete responce for the question, offer follow-up questions to seek more information.
